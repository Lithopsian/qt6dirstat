     * Simple popup dialog to show a message just prior to a lengthy operation.
     * The popup does some event handling to make sure that it really appears
     * before that lengthy operation starts: it processes events for some
     * milliseconds so that its own show, resize, move and paint events are
     * processed.
     *
     * Usage:
     *
     *	   BusyPopup msg( "Calculating...", mainWin );
     *	   calc();
     *
     * In the normal case, just let the variable go out of scope, and the popup
     * is destroyed and thus closed. Of course you can also create it with
     * 'new' and destroy it with 'delete' or simply call 'hide()'.
