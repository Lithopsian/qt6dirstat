	 * try some variations of the layout and maybe backtrack to the
	 * previous attempt. But it results in tiles that are much more
	 * square-like, i.e. have more reasonable width-to-height ratios. It is

	 * representation anyway (it would be way too small). They are
	 * summarized in some kind of 'misc stuff' area in the parent treemap
	 * tile - in fact, part of the parent directory's tile can be "seen
	 * through".
