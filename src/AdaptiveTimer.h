     * Timer for delivering signals that each obsolete each previous one, for
     * example for an expensive blocking operation to retrieve the contents of
     * a widget.
     *
     * Infrequent requests can be delivered on a zero timer, as soon as the Qt
     * event loop processes them.
     *
     * When requests are made more quickly, a delay can be introduced before a
     * request is delivered for execution, and previous requests still waiting
     * will be discarded as they are now obsolete.
     *
     * The delay in delivering a request is configurable as a multiple of the
     * time that it took the previous request to complete.  This avoids pointlessly
     * penalising users with fast hardware or when lookups are coming from cache,
     * but reduces lockups with real lookups on slower hardware.

         * The delay stage will only escalate as many times as the number of delays
         * in the list.  The number of cooldowns will typically be the same as the
         * number of delays.  If there are more cooldowns than delays, the extra delays
         * will never be reached.  If there are fewer cooldowns, the extra delay stages

         * reached.
         *
         * An empty cooldowns list effectively means only the first stage will ever
         * be used.  This will typically deliver the requests with a zero delay.  An
         * empty delays list means that a fixed default delay will be used, but for
         * this the alternate constructor should be used.
         *
         * The delays will typically be longer for higher stages, while the cooldowns
         * will be shorter so that the longer delays are only used for repidly-repeated
         * requests while shorter delays will be used for less frequent requests.
